The updated file contents with the React dependency updated to version 17 would be:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^17.0.1",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^17.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.0",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "web-vitals": "^1.0.1"
  }
}
```

Make sure to update the version numbers of both "react" and "react-dom" dependencies to version "^17.0.0".
