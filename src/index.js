Ticket Title: Implement Test Cases for Main Application 

Ticket Description: 
We need to ensure all aspects of our application behave as expected. To achieve this, new code that creates test cases for our main application must be written.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The test suite should be created in a new file at the path "src/tests/index.test.js".
2. The test suite should import necessary dependencies from React, Redux, and our main application component.
3. There should be a test case that checks if the App component renders without errors.
4. Test(s) checking if Redux store is working properly within the application should be added.
5. The test cases should use appropriate Jest and Enzyme assertions to confirm component behavior.

Example Code:
Please note the code is an example and the actual implementation may vary based on the App design.

```javascript
// Example test case code

// Import react, redux and other necessary dependencies
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';

// Import main application component
import App from '../App';
import rootReducer from '../reducers/rootReducer';  // Assuming rootReducer.js is our reducer file

// Create a store for testing the Redux with initial state
const store = createStore(rootReducer);

it('renders App componenet without crashing', () => {
  shallow(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  );
});

it('checks if Redux store is working correctly', () => {
  expect(store.getState()).toBeDefined(); // This is a simple test to see if the state exists. More complex testing could be depending on how the Redux is supposed to behave.
});
```

Please create the necessary test cases following the example above, modifying as needed to suit our application's requirements.
