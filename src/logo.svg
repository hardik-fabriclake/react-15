Ticket Title: Write Test Cases for Logo Module in the Project

Ticket Description:

We need to adapt our strategy to include comprehensive testing. As such, we need you to write effective unit and integration tests to assess our `Logo` component. All tests should be written using the existing dependencies outlined in the document, specifically `@testing-library/react` for executing the tests and `@testing-library/user-event` for simulating user interactions. 

Tasks:
- Using `@testing-library/react`, test that the `Logo` component correctly mounts on render.
  
- Write a test case to verify that the `Logo` component renders correctly concerning layout and design â€” check key elements such as colors, shape, position, etc. using the `getByTestId` function from `@testing-library/dom`.
  
- With `@testing-library/user-event`, simulate and test possible user interactions with the `Logo`. Is it clickable? Does it lead to the homepage when clicked?

- Ensure that your test cases check for both the presence and the correct functioning of the `Logo`. 

- Lastly, perform a manual review of the test results to ensure there are no false positives/negatives, and resolve any failing tests.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All test cases pass successfully with the current component code.
- Different aspects such as the rendering and possible interactions with the `Logo` should be covered.
- The changes should be reflected in the "src/logo.svg" file path.
- No regression bugs are introduced.
- All test cases should follow established testing and company guidelines and best practices.

Notes:
- Run all tests before adding them to source control to ensure their correct operation.
- Test cases should be isolated to avoid any unrelated failures.
- When writing your tests, ensure that your setup and cleanup are done correctly to avoid any false positives/negatives.
