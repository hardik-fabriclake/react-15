Ticket Title: Create Unit Tests for CSS Properties 

Ticket Description: 

As part of our continuous integration and quality assurance process, we would like to add test cases for the existing CSS properties in our `src/App.css` file to ensure that all styles are rendering as expected. 

The following tests should be written:

1. App Component:
- Check if App component has `text-align` set to `center`.

2. App-logo Component:
- Check if `App-logo` component has `height` set to `40vmin`.
- Confirm `pointer-events` is set to `none`.
- Verify the animation name and duration used in `App-logo`. It should be `App-logo-spin`, `infinite`, `20s`, `linear`.

3. Media Query (@media):
- Verify if the media query `(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` is used and if `animation` within it is the same as in the App-logo.

4. App-header Component:
- Test if `App-header` background-color is `#282c34`.
- Check if `min-height` is `100vh`.
- Verify `display`, `flex-direction`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, `font-size`, and `color` properties match with the existing CSS.

5. App-link Component:
- Confirm if `color` is set to `#61dafb`.

6. App-logo-spin Keyframes Animation:
- Validate the `from` and `to` transform properties of `@keyframes App-logo-spin` are correct.

Note: Each test should be written as a separate function and should output a clear message whether the test has passed or failed. This will greatly help developers to identify any undesired changes in the CSS during future development cycles.
