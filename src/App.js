Ticket Title: Update src/App.js with new instructions

Ticket Description:

Task:
We need to update the code in the file path "src/App.js".

Current State:
The current file contains a default code of a React application structure that displays a header with a logo, a text prompt to edit the file and a link to learn React. This code sets up a basic React Component called "App" and exports it by default.

Required Changes:

1. Delete the existing code in "src/App.js".
2. Replace with new code instructions sent by the development team.
3. Ensure the new code is syntactically correct and aligns with our formatting guidelines.
4. Test the new code in a local environment to ensure it is functioning correctly.
5. Commit and push the code changes to the repository.
6. Open a pull request for the changes to be reviewed by the team.

If there are any issues or if assistance is needed, please communicate promptly.

Note:
It is important to follow the guidelines and principles of our development process. We need to ensure that all actions are documented and that frequent commit messages are written that accurately reflect the changes made. 

Additional Resources:
If you are new to React, consider reading the official documentation to understand the basics: https://reactjs.org

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Code in "src/App.js" has been replaced with new instructions.
2. No syntax or formatting errors are present in the updated "src/App.js".
3. The application functions correctly when running locally.
4. The code changes have been committed, pushed to the repository, and a PR has been opened for review.
