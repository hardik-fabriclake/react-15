Ticket Title: Update the `src/App.js` file in the codebase

Ticket Description: 

We are required to perform an update operation on the existing `src/App.js` file. Here's what the updated codebase should contain:

- Keep the imported 'logo', './App.css', and React modules intact.
- Make sure the function 'App()' returns the following structure:
    1. A `div` element with className 'App'.
    2. Inside this `div`, have a header tag with className 'App-header'.
    3. Inside this header, maintain the current structure i.e., an `img` tag for logo with the given attributes, a `p` tag to display instructions and an `a` tag for the hyperlink.
- The hyperlink should open in a blank window/tab and it shouldn't pass the referrer information to the new page.  
- Ensure that App function is the default exported module from the file.

This will help us maintain the structure and functionality of the webpage. Completion of these tasks will be tracked in this ticket. 

Acceptance Criteria:
The task will be considered complete when the `src/App.js` file includes the updated code as discussed above and the web page is adequately rendering the updated App function.
