Ticket Title: Write Test Cases for src/setupTests.js

Ticket Description: 

We need to increase test coverage for our project to ensure that all functionality is behaving as expected. This task requires the addition of new test cases in the file "src/setupTests.js". 

Please consider the following instructions while working on this task:

1. Write a test case to ensure that the main application component (App) renders correctly. 

2. Add test cases for each component in the application that ensure the component renders without errors.

3. Write a test that checks for the presence of specific text or elements on the rendered component. Pick any key text or element according to the functionality of the component.

4. Add a few test-cases for user interactions such as clicks or form submissions if applicable, and verify that the expected result is achieved.

5. Despite the original code not being included, remember to thoroughly test each function or method linked to the states or props of the components for any potential edge cases. 

6. Try to achieve the highest possible test coverage, ideally we want to cover as much of the code as practicable.

Ensure that all the tests pass without any errors or warnings before submitting your code for review. If there are any failing tests, troubleshoot and provide fixes for the failures. 

Please document any potential challenges or dependencies that you encounter while working on this task.

Estimated Time: (Depends on the size and complexity of the components)

Acceptance Criteria:

1. New test cases are added to the file at "src/setupTests.js". 
2. The added test cases cover application component rendering, specific element rendering, user interactions and function testing.
3. Test coverage is significantly increased.
4. All added test cases pass without any errors or warnings.
5. Project builds successfully after incorporating the new test cases.
6. Peer code review is completed and code passes review without major issues.
