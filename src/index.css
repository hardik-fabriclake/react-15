Ticket title: Write test cases for CSS properties

Ticket description:

As our project involves frequent UI changes, we need to ensure that our core stylesheet properties are always maintained. This ticket involves writing test cases for the "src/index.css" file targeting the "body" and "code" CSS selectors, as well as checking for the existence and correctness of imported dependencies. 

Tasks:

1. Write a test case for the "body" selector.
- Should check if the margin is set to 0 and 10px for '.React'.
- Should verify the font-family.
- Should check -webkit-font-smoothing and -moz-osx-font-smoothing values.

2. Write a test case for the "code" selector.
- Should verify the font-family.
- Should verify 'font-size' is set to '12px' for '.React'.

3. Write a test case for the ".dependencies" selector.
- Should verify that each dependency and its version exists.

Note: For task #3, please make sure to write separate test sub-cases for each of the dependencies to easily identify the missing or incorrectly versioned dependencies.

Time estimation: 4 hours

Acceptance Criteria:

- Each test case must pass with the current CSS properties.
- If a test case fails due to a CSS property different than expected, it must be identified and fixed.
- The code should be easy to understand and maintain in the future.
- Upon code review, test cases must cover all the areas mentioned above.

Please remember to update this ticket as progress is made, and to ask for any clarification or help if needed.
